# EZ Connections

## Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project is to give users a seamless way to get help on the New York Times Connections Game. This chrome extension gives users a way to ask for hints as they solve the puzzle. After clicking the hint button for the first time, there will be a hint created using OpenAI to give the player a hint to what the next easiest category is. If the user is still stuck after the hint given, it then gives the user the title of the easiest category. After the two hints given, if the user still cannot figure out the correct tiles, our program highlights a correct tile for the corresponding category.
